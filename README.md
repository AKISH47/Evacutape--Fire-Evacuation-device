# Evacutape- A fire evacuation device- For National Engineering Design Challenge --https://nedc.mesausa.org/

## Overview

Evacutape is a fire evacuation device that uses a led strip to show  route to the exit. Evacutape can be used in office buildings to make the exit route more visible during a fire.

## Problem
1. Every year, thereâ€™s an average of 358,300 home-based fires.

2.The CDC reported in 2013 that over 125,000 children were treated for burns.

3.There were over 14,000 fire injuries as a result of 364,000 residential fires in 2016.

## Proposed Solution
1.Get input from a gas sensor to detect whether the air is polluted by particles of smoke and a temperature sensor that senses the temperature of the area.
2. Using the input we can decide to turn the led strip on or off.
